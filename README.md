# CS-300

The problem that I was solving in the projects for this course was how to organize, add, and remove data within data structures. 
I approached this problem by learning about which data structure would work best for the type of project required. Each type has different pros and cons to each and it was important to learn which would work best for each assignment.
The roadblock that I encountered when working through project one was creating the data analysis. It was a little confusing, but I went back into zybooks and looked at more examples and I felt that I was able to figure it out.
My work on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs because I now have an understanding of the different types of data structures and how certain ones could be better suited for certain situations than the others.
My work on this project evolved the way that I write programs because I was able to learn more about the differnt types of data structures and how they interact with different parts of the code. By properly labeling and leaving annotations in my code, it is more easily able to be maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
